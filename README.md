### Project Overview

Title: _"Image Slider"_

> GitHub: [link](https://github.com/albchia/Image-Slider.git)

This project has been inspired by [@Clever Techie](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1WxZFhq56xs1oxXH-XveSQ). I decided to pick his tutorial as training and inspiration to create my own image slider working with the basic elements of `HMTL` and `CSS`.
